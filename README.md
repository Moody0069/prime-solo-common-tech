# Solo Project - Commonly Used Tech

When working with React, any third party library that displays something on the DOM (e.g. charts and maps) will need to support the **virtual DOM**. Libraries that don't have a visual component (e.g. Filestack and Moment.js) can be used as is. 

## Material Design

Material UI has pre-buuilt components styled using [Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/). It's a great way to add styling without having to write a lot of CSS from scratch.

`npm install @material-ui/core --save`

## Charts

Chart.js is a library for displaying charts and graphs within your web application.

`npm install react-chartjs-2 chart.js --save`

## Timeline Graph

Vis.js is a visualization library. The timeline examples provide a [React demo](http://visjs.org/examples/timeline/other/usingReact.html). Other types of graphs do not appear to have React templates at this time. Please read the documentation and createa proof of concept before choosing this library for your project.
